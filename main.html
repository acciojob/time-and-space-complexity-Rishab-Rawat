    <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity is a critical concept in computer science that measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. Time complexity is an important factor in designing efficient algorithms, ensuring faster performance even with large datasets.

        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires relative to the input size. It is typically expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input. Efficient management of <b>Space Complexity</b> is crucial for optimizing the performance of algorithms, especially in memory-constrained environments.
